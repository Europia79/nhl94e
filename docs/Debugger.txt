Geiger personality traits

There is a rich assortment of SNES debugging tools out there, some of which are in active development.

I still use Geiger's SNES debugger for a lot of things. It's a great tool and is super useful. That said, it has some bugs/limitations/'personality traits'. I've come to work around them, or use a different tool as appropriate then switch back.

The emulator-debugger is closed source and not under active development, so these 'personality traits' are not going away any time soon.

I've made a list of the 'personality traits' so that you can also work around them if you run into them.

Issue										Workaround
=====										==========
Breakpoints don't hit after certain operations (e.g., save state load)		Re-open the breakpoint window, and click OK
Step Out doesn't step out to the expected place					Don't rely on Step Out for functions that straddle VBlanks
'Show Hex' (memory) window shows blank ROM on 1st open				Choose something (e.g., RAM) 'viewing' dropdown then go back to ROM
Emulator crash if you scroll too far down in the memory window			Don't use invalid ranges. Don't try to scroll past the end of the range.
Can not view DBR or PBR								Edit some code to push them (PHB/PHK) then PLA
DMA Special Tracing- what does the output mean?					See below
Can not view CGRAM or OAM							Use a different debugger

There could be things not specified here. I use some 10% or 20% of the tool's features.
