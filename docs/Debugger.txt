Geiger personality traits

There is a rich assortment of SNES debugging tools out there, some of which are in active development.

I still use Geiger's SNES debugger for a lot of things. It's a great tool and is super useful. That said, it has some bugs/limitations/'personality traits'. I've come to work around them, or use a different tool as appropriate then switch back.

The emulator-debugger is closed source and not under active development, unlikely to be changed by the author or community so these 'personality traits' are not going away any time soon. I made a list of the 'personality traits' so that you can also work around them if you run into them.

Issue										Workaround
=====										==========
Breakpoints don't hit after certain operations (e.g., save state load)		Re-open the breakpoint window, and click OK
Step Out doesn't step out to the expected place					Don't rely on Step Out for functions that straddle VBlanks
'Show Hex' (memory) window shows blank ROM on 1st open				Choose something (e.g., RAM) 'viewing' dropdown then go back to ROM
Emulator crash if you scroll too far down in the memory window			Don't use invalid ranges. Don't try to scroll past the end of the range.
Can not view DBR or PBR								Edit some code to push them (PHB/PHK) then PLA
DMA Special Tracing- what does the output mean?					See below
Can not view CGRAM or OAM							Use a different debugger

There could be things not specified here. I use some 10% or 20% of the tool's features.

DMA transfer tracing format
===========================
Enabling debug tracing of DMA transfers causes some debug output to appear on each transfer.

Example:
DMA[1]: CPU->PPU Mode:0 0x7F0000->0x2122 Bytes:200 (inc) V:128 CGRAM: 00 (0)
   #0      #1                   #2          #3      #4    #5      #6

Here is what this output means.

#0: Which channel is it.
#1: Pretty obvious, the source and dest component.
#2: Source address to dest gate. Here is what the gates mean
		0x2104	OAM
		0x2118 	VRAM
		0x2122	CGRAM
#3: How many bytes are being transferred.
#4: CPU address counting mode. It can be 'inc' or 'fixed'.
#5: I thiiiink this is what scanline we're on.
#6: Dest address in the non-WRAM memory. For example, in this case, it's a CGRAM address. If we were transferring to VRAM, it's say VRAM: [number].
