White flicker when switching between tabs quickly
	- Reproes in both debug and release
	- Reproes even when you remove all rows
	- Reproes regardless of switching from double-buffered control to single (System::Windows::Forms::DataGridView)
	- Reproes even if you have 1 column and no rows, but it is less obvious
	- Reproes with 7 or more pages
	- Doesn't seem to repro with only 3 teams (tab pages)
