Setting 1 byte of staging affects a bunch of bytes in the shorts.
All bytes are copied verbatim.
There are none of the shorts, it looks like, that aren't present in the staging.

Setting 00 in staging affects 40, 41, 42, 60 in shorts.
Setting some bytes in staging affects nothing.

The format of the staging buffer is as follows:
	"Dictionary values"- Some values from 0 to FF. They are in ascending order. Some values are repeated. Each value may be copied some number of times to the shorts. Some values are ignored.
	The values cycle some number of times.
	Dictionary values comprise 0x100 bytes.
	
	"Descriptors"- Some values from 0 to 10. They are in ascending order. Some values are repeated. These values are not copied as is. Hacking them can cause decompression to not work. There is some significance as to how many copies of values there are. The values affect the locations of dictionary items being copied.
	Descriptors are always even numbers.
	Descriptors are always 0x100 bytes.
	
	So the staging takes up 0x200 bytes total.
	
	Each 1 byte of dictionary value corresopnds to 1 descriptor.
	Dictionary values are all loaded from cache.
	Descriptors all start at 0 and go up to 0x12.
	For choosing how many of a pair to write, it depends. The first pairs span e.g., 64 bytes, the last pair spans 1 byte.
	In this way, the staging buffer is not super optimal but oh well.
