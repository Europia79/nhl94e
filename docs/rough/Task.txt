Setting 1 byte of staging affects a bunch of bytes in the shorts.
All bytes are copied verbatim.
There are none of the shorts, it looks like, that aren't present in the staging.

Setting 00 in staging affects 40, 41, 42, 60 in shorts.
Setting some bytes in staging affects nothing.

The format of the staging buffer is as follows:
	Some values from 0 to FF. They are in ascending order. Some values are repeated. Each value may be copied some number of times to the shorts. Some values are ignored.
	Some values from 0 to 10. They are in ascending order. Some values are repeated. These values are not copied as is. Hacking them can cause decompression to not work. There is some significance as to how many copies of values there are. The values affect the locations of dictionary items being copied.
